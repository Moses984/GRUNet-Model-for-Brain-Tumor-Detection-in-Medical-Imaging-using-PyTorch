\# GRUNet Model for Brain Tumor Detection in Medical Imaging using PyTorch



This repository contains the code, data structure, and presentation slides for a graduate-level term project focused on **brain tumor detection** using a **GRUNet** **(Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network)**. The model is implemented in **PyTorch** and trained on medical MRI images to classify between tumor and non-tumor cases.

\## 🧠 Project Overview



Brain tumors present a critical health challenge requiring timely and accurate diagnosis. This project leverages GRUNet to detect patterns in MRI scan data and perform binary classification, improving the potential for early diagnosis through deep learning.
